Active on Farcaster\n• Even if you are not on the weekly leaderboard, CROSSPOST! It takes minimal effort and you should be crossposting to both Warpcast and Hey at the least\n\n2. Funded Wallet\n• The wording is a little ambiguous here so I would make sure to have at least $10 of USDC AND ETH in your Warpcast wallet\n\n3. At least 1x transaction\n• A key section here is at least, I would recommend doing more than 1 transaction, test new mini apps and have fun\n\n4. Use mini apps daily\n• Self-explanatory, just explore and have fun. If you are lazy you could even just do the Monad testnet wheel daily and leave it at that (would recommend using live mainnets too though)",

DeFi users do not want idle assets so there is not much point launching chains if you have nowhere to deploy funds\n\nI would love to see Infinex build more partnerships like this with projects like Succinct, Monad, and Eclipse. The opportunity to remove the cross-chain friction is immense to open doors for chains to onboard users.

Nevertheless, I like the abstraction narrative\n\n0G: Look past it at this point, ignore the insane funding\n\nEclipse: Haven't kept too up to date but sentiment seems to have shifted to where people think it won't perform too well, I think early grass farmers can still get a decent return\n\nFogo: All about speed. Do we need a new chain? Probably not. Does Fogo seem underfarmed? Yes.\n\nHuma: Quick to execute the airdrop, let's see how this goes\n\nHumanity Protocol: Been dragging their feet for a long time, would be surprised if any regular sign-ups make anything more than a few $\n\nHyperbolic: Has been on my to-do list to research more, could be a bit of a sleeper\n\nLombard: Outside of the large yapper incentives, I don't see this being able to provide a crazy airdrop as it's been around for a while and has the largest BTC LST TVL (dilution)\n\nMegaETH: Think there will be opportunities here and haven't seen too much testnet buzz, someone loop me in\n\nMitosis: Campaigns running for a while but I like the team and the creativity behind its BD, airdrop wise I think it will be above average but nothing life-changing\n\nMonad: Insane ecosystem, definitely some opportunities to cook if you're willing to get in the trenches for things like Monadverse WL (shameless plug haha)\n\nMultipli: Definitely a fan as you can earn strong yield whilst also farming a future airdrop\n\nNewton: Was irrelevant until Kaito, crazy funding and interesting premise but haven't really explored and feel it will be diluted\n\nNovastro: Can probably look past\n\nOpenLedger: In terms of airdrops I view it pretty meh\n\nParadex: Think there is some opportunity here to make a buck, can also earn solid XP by yapping, S2 ends soon and has been underfarmed (not nearly as little as S1 though)\n\nSatLayer: Similar thesis to Lombard, would've hoped they already did an airdrop\n\nSidekick: Interesting product shifts by going for streaming but considering the amount of time they have been around I wouldn't expect a juicy airdrop\n\nSkate: Strong narrative and defintiely something to keep eyes on, not too much you can do right now (almost like Infinex was for a long time)\n\nSomnia: Similar to MegaETH I am sure there is a lot of opportunity here but I haven't been tapped into the testnet and am weary of some of the people shilling\n\nSOON: Alright\n\nSophon: High TVL leads me to believe it is mainly just a little extra APY\n\nSoul Protocol: Pretty much know nothing, someone loop me in\n\nSuccinct: Definitely has potential due to the limited amount of users that have been able to engage with the testnet campaigns\n\nSymphony: Cool product idea but not much of a gauge yet\n\nTheoriq: Can join waitlist but not much to know yet\n\nThrive Protocol: Nothing crazy expected\n\nUnion: Think this will cook for the die-hard farmoors. I am a button clicker but not enough to be a Union farmer",

Now most of the projects giving $50 - $200 for free Airdrops & more for capital based Airdrops\n🤓He was shocked & asked me to guide about free Airdrops, he felt $50 is lot for free tasks\n\n7️⃣Finally I started explaining him about Defi, L1s L2s etc etc\n😩Everything went over his head & he gave up the idea immediately \n\n🔚End of the story\n\n👇Moral of the Story\n❌He is not a dumbo, he is well educated, he works in a big entity in senior role.\n🤓But he couldn't understand much about crypto, Airdrops & stuff\n\n😎So if u r here grinding Airdrops everyday\n🫵U r not any ordinary person\n👑U r a hero of this space, be proud of yourself if u r in this space\n\n🎩Hats off to all those crypto users clicking in this space.\n\n🤔Don't believe in my story?

Let me know in comments section. Agree with me?\n\n😁Let's hope team will make necessary changes in allocation\n\n🤔I think one of the reason for less allocation is, 500k+ eligible users\n🤔Even after above adjustment there may not be big changes.. But let's hope for the best\n\n😉if there r no changes in allocation, I will giveaway 50% of my allocation to community\n\n💙Like\n🔁RT",
