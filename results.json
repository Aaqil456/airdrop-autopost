Active on Farcaster\n• Even if you are not on the weekly leaderboard, CROSSPOST! It takes minimal effort and you should be crossposting to both Warpcast and Hey at the least\n\n2. Funded Wallet\n• The wording is a little ambiguous here so I would make sure to have at least $10 of USDC AND ETH in your Warpcast wallet\n\n3. At least 1x transaction\n• A key section here is at least, I would recommend doing more than 1 transaction, test new mini apps and have fun\n\n4. Use mini apps daily\n• Self-explanatory, just explore and have fun. If you are lazy you could even just do the Monad testnet wheel daily and leave it at that (would recommend using live mainnets too though)",
